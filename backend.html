    <em>November 2022 - Present</em> </h3>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Designed, developed, and maintained cloud-based Python
    microservices, implementing best practices for scalability, fault
    tolerance, and data consistency in a distributed
    environment.</p></li>
    <li><p>Created and maintained reusable GraphQL endpoints, using
    Fastify, Node.js and TypeScript. These served as a gateway and data
    aggregation layer between gRPC microservice endpoints, legacy REST
    API endpoints and the front-end application.</p></li>
    <li><p>Utilized Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services including
    Kubernetes Engine, Artifact Registry, Pub/Sub, gRPC, Cloud Storage
    Buckets, and Secret Manager for application deployment,
    communication, and storage.</p></li>
    <li><p>Maintained highly available order processing and vendor
    integration services for a marketplace platform handling 10+
    orders/min ($10M+ 2024 revenue). Resolved critical production issues
    within SLAs as part of an Agile Scrum team.</p></li>
    <li><p>Contributed significantly to integrating external services
    APIs—such as Netsuite and Akeneo— into our platform to streamline
    business processes, improving efficiency in the product
    merchandising pipeline by 66.6%.</p></li>
    <li><p>Optimized database operations by migrating expensive MySQL
    queries to read-only replicas after identifying bottlenecks during
    execution. Increased performance in microservice endpoints by
    implementing caching layers using Redis.</p></li>
    <li><p>Developed a proof of concept for CI/CD pipeline optimization
    that demonstrated a 50% reduction in build times, leading to a
    company-wide adoption.</p></li>

    <ul>
    <li><p>Developed multiple web applications using Python, Django,
    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with PostgreSQL as the database. This was
    part of an initiative to reduce paperwork and optimize business
    processes.</p></li>
    <li><p>Developed a centralized RESTful API to handle authentication
    across multiple web applications, internally connecting to an LDAP
    Active Directory user database, using Flask and Python.</p></li>
    <li><p>Designed and implemented a temperature and humidity
    monitoring system in glass assembly plants using LoraWAN. Led the
    entire hardware selection, configuration, and installation process,
    and developed a real-time dashboard using Python, Django Channels,
    Websockets, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.</p></li>
    <li><p>Played a major role in containerizing applications and
    deploying in bare-metal on-premise servers using Docker and Docker
    Compose.</p></li>
