    <strong>Software Engineer</strong> at <a
    href="https://www.achievers.com/">Achievers</a>, Toronto
    <em>November 2022 - Present</em> </h3>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Designed, developed, and maintained cloud-based Python
    microservices for a global B2B SaaS, utilizing Google Cloud
    services—such as gRPC and PubSub for service communication and
    Kubernetes (GKE) for scalable deployment.</p></li>
    <li><p>Created and maintained reausable GraphQL endpoints, using
    Fastify, Node.js and TypeScript. These served as a gateway and data
    aggregation layer between gRPC microservice endpoints, legacy REST
    API endpoints and the front-end application.</p></li>
    <li><p>Implemented new components in our React front-end application
    —written in JavaScript—, following design guidelines and Figma
    prototypes provided by the Product and UX Design teams.</p></li>
    <li><p>Core developer on the marketplace team—responsible for a
    platform that processes 10+ orders per minute, and drove over $10M
    in revenue in 2024. Operated within an Agile Scrum environment and
    maintained highly available order processing and vendor integration
    services, resolving order and catalog issues promptly within
    SLAs.</p></li>
    <li><p>Contributed significantly to integrating external services
    APIs—such as Netsuite and Akeneo— into our platform to streamline
    business processes, improving efficiency in the product
    merchandising pipeline by 66.6%.</p></li>
    <li><p>Optimized database operations by migrating expensive MySQL
    queries to read-only replicas after identifying bottlenecks during
    execution. Increased performance in microservice endpoints by
    implementing caching layers using Redis.</p></li>
    <li><p>Implemented proof of concept for CI/CD pipeline optimization,
    by using a new Python package manager. This reduced build times by
    over 50% and was implemented for all services across the
    company.</p></li>

    <ul>
    <li><p>Developed multiple full stack web applications using Python,
    Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with PostgreSQL as the database.
    This was part of an initiative to reduce paperwork and optimize
    business processes.</p></li>
    <li><p>Developed a centralized RESTf API to handle authentication
    across multiple web applications, internally connecting to an LDAP
    Active Directory user database, using Flask and Python.</p></li>
    <li><p>Designed and implemented a temperature and humidity
    monitoring system in glass assembly plants using LoraWAN. Led the
    entire hardware selection, configuration, and installation process,
    and developed a real-time dashboard using Python, Django Channels,
    Websockets, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.</p></li>
    <li><p>Played a major role in containerizing applications and
    deploying in bare-metal on-premise servers using Docker and Docker
    Compose.</p></li>
