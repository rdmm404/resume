    <strong>Software Engineer</strong> at <a
    href="https://www.achievers.com/">Achievers</a>, Toronto
    <em>November 2022 - Present</em> </h3>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Designed, developed, and maintained cloud-based Python
    microservices for a global B2B SaaS, utilizing Google Cloud
    services—such as gRPC and PubSub for service communication and
    Kubernetes (GKE) for scalable deployment.</p></li>
    <li><p>Created and maintained reusable GraphQL endpoints, using
    Fastify, Node.js and TypeScript. These served as a gateway and data
    aggregation layer between gRPC microservice endpoints, legacy REST
    API endpoints and the front-end application.</p></li>
    <li><p>Developed React components (JavaScript) across multiple micro
    frontends managed by the Single SPA framework, collaborating closely
    with Product and UX Design teams to implement features based on
    Figma prototypes.</p></li>
    <li><p>Maintained highly available order processing and vendor
    integration services for a marketplace platform handling 10+
    orders/min ($10M+ 2024 revenue). Resolved critical production issues
    within SLAs as part of an Agile Scrum team.</p></li>
    <li><p>Contributed significantly to integrating external services
    APIs—such as Netsuite and Akeneo— into our platform to streamline
    business processes, improving efficiency in the product
    merchandising pipeline by 66.6%.</p></li>
    <li><p>Optimized database operations by migrating expensive MySQL
    queries to read-only replicas after identifying bottlenecks during
    execution. Increased performance in microservice endpoints by
    implementing caching layers using Redis.</p></li>
    <li><p>Developed a proof of concept for CI/CD pipeline optimization
    that demonstrated a 50% reduction in build times, leading to a
    company-wide adoption.</p></li>

    <ul>
    <li><p>Developed multiple full stack web applications using Python,
    Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with PostgreSQL as the database.
    This was part of an initiative to reduce paperwork and optimize
    business processes.</p></li>
    <li><p>Developed a centralized RESTful API to handle authentication
    across multiple web applications, internally connecting to an LDAP
    Active Directory user database, using Flask and Python.</p></li>
    <li><p>Designed and implemented a temperature and humidity
    monitoring system in glass assembly plants using LoraWAN. Led the
    entire hardware selection, configuration, and installation process,
    and developed a real-time dashboard using Python, Django Channels,
    Websockets, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.</p></li>
    <li><p>Played a major role in containerizing applications and
    deploying in bare-metal on-premise servers using Docker and Docker
    Compose.</p></li>
