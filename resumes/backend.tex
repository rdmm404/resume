  \textit{November 2022 - Present}
}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Designed, developed, and maintained cloud-based Python microservices, implementing best practices
    for scalability, fault tolerance, and data consistency in a distributed environment.
  \item Created and maintained reusable GraphQL endpoints, using Fastify, Node.js and TypeScript. These served as a gateway and data
    aggregation layer between gRPC microservice endpoints, legacy REST API endpoints and the front-end application.
  \item Utilized Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services including Kubernetes Engine, Artifact Registry,
    Pub/Sub, gRPC, Cloud Storage Buckets, and Secret Manager for application deployment, communication, and storage.
  \item Maintained highly available order processing and vendor integration services for a marketplace platform
    handling 10+ orders/min (\$10M+ 2024 revenue). Resolved critical production issues within SLAs as part of an Agile Scrum team.
  \item Contributed significantly to integrating external services APIs---such as Netsuite and Akeneo--- into our platform to streamline
    business processes, improving efficiency in the product merchandising pipeline by 66.6\%.
  \item Optimized database operations by migrating expensive MySQL queries to read-only replicas after identifying
    bottlenecks during execution. Increased performance in microservice endpoints by implementing caching layers
    using Redis.
  \item Developed a proof of concept for CI/CD pipeline optimization that demonstrated
    a 50\% reduction in build times, leading to a company-wide adoption.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed multiple web applications using Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with PostgreSQL as the database.
    This was part of an initiative to reduce paperwork and optimize business processes.
    \item Developed a centralized RESTful API to handle authentication across multiple web applications, internally connecting to an
    LDAP Active Directory user database, using Flask and Python.
  \item Designed and implemented a temperature and humidity monitoring system in glass assembly plants using LoraWAN.
    Led the entire hardware selection, configuration, and installation process, and developed a real-time
    dashboard using Python, Django Channels, Websockets, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
  \item Played a major role in containerizing applications and deploying in bare-metal on-premise servers using Docker and Docker Compose.
